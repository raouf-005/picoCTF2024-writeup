# PicoCTF 2024 Pwn Challenges

This repository contains solutions to the Pwn category challenges from PicoCTF 2024. Pwn challenges typically involve exploiting vulnerabilities in binary executables to gain control over the program and/or the system it runs on.

## Usage

Each challenge folder contains the following:

- **sol.py**: Python script for exploiting the vulnerability.
- **flag.txt**: Flag obtained by exploiting the challenge.
- **README.md**: Detailed explanation of the vulnerability and the exploit used.

Feel free to explore the solutions and learn from them. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me at [raouf.ard@gmail.com](mailto:raouf.ard@gmail.com).

Happy hacking!
